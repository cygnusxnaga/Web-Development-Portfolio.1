            <h1>- Overview - </h1>
            <h3>The essentials and competencies in Domain 7: Culturally-Sensitive Care were met through NG 742 Population Health for Advanced Practice Nursing. This course allowed for conceptualizing the foundations of culturally sensitive population health in advanced nursing practice</h3>

            <h3>Chronic care management, quality and safety, public health, and health policy (Nash, Skoufalos, Fabius & Oglesby, 2021) are the basis of the four pillars of population health. The four pillars of population health work together to improve the health of a community. Working with an interprofessional healthcare team, the goal of achieving better patient outcomes may occur.
            </h3>
            <h3>Throughout history, black women in the United States have endured healthcare inequities. According to Chinn, Martin, and Redmon (2021), contributing factors such as conscious and unconscious bias, racism, gender inequalities, and economic backgrounds are just a few contributing factors that help define this group as vulnerable within the constructs of healthcare.Many factors play a role in the influence of health and wellness. Income, accessibility, and resources may influence health disparities (Nash, Skoufalos, Fabius & Oglesby, 2021). </h3>
            <h3> 	Several health inequities exist with the black women population. This population has high obesity and obesity-related illnesses (Jackson, 2017). This population also has three to four times the maternal mortality rates of non-Hispanic black white women (Chinn, Martin, & Redmond, 2021). These reasons alone identify the importance of studying this vulnerable population.</h3>

            <h3>My work as a nurse practitioner upholds the values of diversity and equity. As a black woman, I understand the importance of representation in the medical field. My goal is to minimize racial disparities among different populations while providing excellent patient care. Recognizing the need for diversity and inclusion in healthcare may be beneficial when providing care to diverse communities. 
            </h3>

            <h3>During my clinical rotation, I have had the opportunity to utilize the values and skills that I bring to this profession. I use compassion, thoughtfulness, and the knowledge I have gained throughout my nursing career and family nurse practitioner program. I plan on impacting society through nursing by allowing patients to be involved in the decision-making process of their care. On one particular occasion, I walked into an exam room ad introduced myself to the patient. I could tell that the patient was uncomfortable and asked if something was wrong. The patient stated, "You seem nice, but I want to see the other nurse practitioner alone today." I reassured the patient that she had every right to decide who she wanted in the exam room with her. 

            </h3>


            <h3>Values that are important to me as an advanced practice nurse are being knowledgeable regarding disease processes and asking for help or guidance in situations that require someone with more experience. It is okay to seek out advice from a more experienced provider.
