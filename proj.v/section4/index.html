                    <li>Significance to Current Healthcare Environment
                        Research suggests quality of life links to one's health status. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines "health" as a multi-facet concept of being "a complete state of physical, mental, and social well-being" (World Health Organization, 1948). The significance of health insurance on one's physical, mental, and social well-being can hugely affect one's quality of life. The ability to afford healthcare prevention and treatment services is empowering. The disparities throughout vulnerable communities in the United States affect health outcomes (Wippold & Roncoroni, 2019). Health outcomes can directly link to the availability of healthcare and health services. 
                        Prevention is the best treatment. With the lack of access to health insurance, individuals may not have the opportunity to partake in preventative medicine. These Individuals are less likely to participate in regular medical visitation to their primary care providers (PCPs) or specialists (Wippold, Nmezi, Williams, Butler & Hodge, 2020). There are socioeconomic disparities that currently exist in healthcare. Many factors play a role in the influence of health and wellness. Income, accessibility, and resources may influence health disparities (Nash, Skoufalos, Fabius & Oglesby, 2021).

            <h3>My work as a nurse practitioner upholds the values of diversity and equity. As a black woman, I understand the importance of representation in the medical field. My goal is to minimize racial disparities among different populations while providing excellent patient care. Recognizing the need for diversity and inclusion in healthcare may be beneficial when providing care to diverse communities. 
            </h3>

            <h3>During my clinical rotation, I have had the opportunity to utilize the values and skills that I bring to this profession. I use compassion, thoughtfulness, and the knowledge I have gained throughout my nursing career and family nurse practitioner program. I plan on impacting society through nursing by allowing patients to be involved in the decision-making process of their care. On one particular occasion, I walked into an exam room ad introduced myself to the patient. I could tell that the patient was uncomfortable and asked if something was wrong. The patient stated, "You seem nice, but I want to see the other nurse practitioner alone today." I reassured the patient that she had every right to decide who she wanted in the exam room with her. 

            </h3>


            <h3>Values that are important to me as an advanced practice nurse are being knowledgeable regarding disease processes and asking for help or guidance in situations that require someone with more experience. It is okay to seek out advice from a more experienced provider.
