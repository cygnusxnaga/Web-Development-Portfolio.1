              <h3>
                    Every practitioner has a philosophical approach to the healing process. Becoming an advanced practice nurse allows for the ability to spend time focusing on the holistic needs of the patients. Each patient has their own needs. Nursing is a science and an art and is said to be a noble profession. The nursing profession is essential for patient advocacy. As advocates, nurses can defend patient rights and represent the interests of patients while ensuring quality care. 
                    My belief when it comes to caring for patients is it is essential to acknowledge each patient's individual needs. Patients must know that their wants and needs matter when facilitating their care. One example of this philosophy is establishing a therapeutic relationship between the patient and the practitioner. Once the patient feels comfortable with their provider may be more inclined to be open and honest. While I pride myself on being attentive to the needs of each patient I provide care to, the quality that makes me a great nurse practitioner is the ability to relate to the population I serve. Patients do not need judgment; they need quality care from an individual that understands them.

I use compassion, thoughtfulness, and the knowledge I have gained throughout my nursing career and family nurse practitioner program. I plan on impacting society through nursing by allowing patients to be involved in the decision-making process of their care. On one particular occasion, I walked into an exam room ad introduced myself to the patient. I could tell that the patient was uncomfortable and asked if something was wrong. The patient stated, "You seem nice, but I want to see the other nurse practitioner alone today." I reassured the patient that she had every right to decide who she wanted in the exam room with her.
